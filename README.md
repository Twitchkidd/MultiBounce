# MultiBounce

Okay, so I refactored it, and don't have time to fix a few things right now, HOWEVER!

## requestAnimationFrame()!

Yaaay it's so much nicer! Thanks [Graham on StackOverflow!](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38709923/why-is-requestanimationframe-better-than-setinterval-or-settimeout)

And Paul Irish and CSS Tricks for everything!

## General refactor!

I used functions and stuff and there's an || in there and did the parentheses thing, and I think it's way more readable. Super happy! Yay!
